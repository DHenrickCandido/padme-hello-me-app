# PadMe - Hello, Me App
This is a simple SwiftUI application created as one of my first solo projects. It's a fun and interactive app that combines a music pad with personal things about me.

# Features

- Things about me: Pressing specific pad combinations reveals details about me, including my interests, hobbies, and background.
